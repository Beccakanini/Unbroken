        The call came as a summons to something greater than a mere performance. <span class="italic text-md ">“Waka Waka Africa,”</span> the request began when a certain man needed an African performer for a fundraiser. 
        This was not a simple invitation; it was a calling I gladly accepted. The profound honour was mine to grace such a stage, to lend my spirit to a purpose that stretched far beyond the footlights. 
        A call was made into the universe, and I, Rugamba, answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, the stage is a sacred battlefield. Dance is the universal language, a shared headspace where souls commune without a word. 
        A song is a vessel for upliftment, and words are the balm to soothe weary spirits. This is the art I bring, the weapon with which I fight.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this event unveiled a deeper truth. I learned of Saint Jude's School in Tanzania. 
        I sat among visionaries whose hearts were irrevocably set upon a single, noble goal: to bring equality and a fundamental sense of dignity to my people. 
        All of us descendants from the distant shores of Fiji, India, Australia, New Zealand and more, a united nations of compassion. 
        And there I was, standing erect in my element, among these giants, lifting my continent through my dance, my music, and my voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        I stood proudly, contributing in my own way to a cause for my people, orchestrated by people who may never set foot on the soil they give life to, who will never drink from the wells they help build. 
        This was the Rotary Club a fellowship where I discovered hearts I once believed existed only in legends. In their selflessness, I saw the living spirit of Mother Teresa, the embodied beliefs of icons like Desmond Tutu and Mahatma Gandhi. 
        They were people who saw inherent good in people like me. In my people.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then, there was him. A man whose presence commanded a unique gravity. “Jitendra!” he announced, his voice a warm embrace. 
        “My name is Jitendra Prasad! You must be Eric! Of course you are!” And I was. 
        My African costume made it obvious, but I believe it was my spirit—alight with purpose—that truly confirmed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        That single performance forged a connection that outlasted the final curtain. It was followed by regular WhatsApp messages, wishes for good days and warm sunshine. 
        They were generic in their way, and I knew they were sent to many—yet that was the very source of their beauty. 
        It was a thoughtful gesture from a profoundly thoughtful man, a testament to a heart that consistently reaches out.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is the way he speaks of his father, with a reverence that transcends mere words, that draws tears to my eyes. 
        His path of fatherly love seems to run parallel to my own, a similar songline of respect, legacy, and devotion. 
        My own father taught me that God’s face is reflected in the countenance of those who wish you well; that divine grace is found in the harmonious dance of body and spirit; 
        and that a man’s worth is measured not by what he accumulates, but by all that he gives.

            To interview Mr. Jitendra is to converse with a familiar soul.
        </p>
      <p>
         His truth is not proclaimed in grand speeches, but attested to through his relentless kindness. 
        It is his unwavering words and his active faith in helping others that has, in turn, raised my own spirit. He is, in a word, unbroken. 
        A man who knows his father’s face not as a memory, but as a living guide. A man deeply connected to his tripartite roots of Fiji, India, and Australia—a powerful representation of intercultural harmony. 
        He is a man worth of the title ‘Sir’ in its truest, most honourable sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        I pray to Rurema, the creator, to guide and protect men like Jitendra as they, in turn, guide younger minds like mine. 
        We are all of us on a battlefield in this life. But armed with the power of God and the strength of prayer, I am proud to serve alongside men of faith, courage, and enduring legacy.
