        Certain phrases are reserved, earned by those who embody the spirit of this sun-baked land. Australia, with its complex history, has a singular genius for wrestling beauty from chaos, giving rise to resilient and beautiful souls. 
        These are men and women who possess a profound, unspoken respect for all life, their fellow humans, the creatures that share the earth, and the very flora that roots them to it.
      </p>

      <p >
        This respect is not mere sentiment; it is a wisdom born of acquired patience, a discipline carved out under the vast antipodean sky. 
        While our souls are wired with instinct for survival, the greater discipline to choose generosity over fear, integrity over convenience is a lesson imparted by our first teachers. 
        For many, these were our parents, who instilled a foundational reverence for something greater than ourselves.

        Mr. and Mrs. Roy Sommerville are true blue Australians, a quality evident in the grain of their character their classic Strine, their dry humour, and the steadfastness forged over fifty-seven years of marriage. 
        They have faced life side-by-side, giving it a "fair go" together. When Mr. Roy first said to me on the phone, “I know you, mate,” his voice carried a calming, familiar timbre. 
        The feeling was fleeting, as he recalled surveying a block for me, and I realized he had me mixed up with another Eric. My ever-churning mind, which has yet to build that house or afford the services of a man of Mr. 
        Roy’s calibre, soon discovered he was a legend in his field—a reputation built on vast experience, impeccable service, and that rare, authentic gentleman’s charm.

        I confess, I do not always approach history without trepidation. There are moments where the weight of the past tempers my present. 
        In spaces with older generations, a silent question arises: What will they see? Will they see my stance, my shoes, the colour of my skin before they hear my voice? 
        This apprehension was acute that day, for my purpose was to ask difficult questions about a man whose reputation had been publicly tarnished a man the papers deemed a fraud, an alleged bankrupt.

        My mind was a whirlwind of doubt. But conviction is like the first rays of the morning sun; once it touches you, you feel its undeniable warmth. 
        I knew that for Zaffar Khan, a man I called a hero, I had to venture into uncomfortable spaces. To walk in a man’s shoes is one thing; but to understand his journey, 
        I had to walk in his footsteps, to trace the path he carved and see the world from the vantage point of his destiny. Unbroken in my mission, I set out to discover if the man I admired was truly the villain others had portrayed.
      </p>

        I was raised to listen to my elders, for they are held by the sacred law of legacy. They have no time for falsehoods. 
        As Ann Sommerville spoke of Zaffar, her passion was immediate and genuine. And Roy his voice the embodiment of an unshakable Aussie spirit doesn’t give a stuff about gossip. 
        As long as he knows the truth, the opinions of others hold no sway. His grit was laid bare in every word. He spoke of a thirty-one-year partnership with Zaffar—a span of time nearly equal to my entire life. 
        In his unwavering account, his loyalty was absolute.
      </p>

        I have been privileged to sit with great men and women.  Emmagness Ruzvidzo a wise woman from Zimbabwe once said that we are our ancestors’ wildest dreams. 
        In that sitting room with the Sommervilles, over a welcome cuppa, her words resonated with profound power. That simple act of hospitality ignited a conversation so rich and freely true, it transcended interview and became communion. 
        I came to learn about Zaffar Khan, but I left having learned about myself. I was reminded that mateship, brotherhood, and family are the pillars for which true individuals stand.
      </p>

      <p class="italic text-md text-[#B8860B]">
        In our conversation, I did not see a caricature of a corrupt businessman. Through the Sommerville’s eyes, I saw the humble man, the victorious entrepreneur, the proud husband. 
        I felt the ease of speaking to a grandfather, a kinship that erased my earlier fears.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the Creator Almighty, I give thanks for Mr. and Mrs. Roy Sommerville. 
        They are living proof that truth is not merely a fact to be discovered, but a decision we make with our tongues a choice to honour legacy over rumour, and to affirm that character, in the end, is what truly defines a man.
